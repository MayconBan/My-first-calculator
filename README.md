# My-first-calculator
This is my first most developed calculator. 
I'm open to tips on how to improve it and then I'll add more operations to it. I got inspirations from 
some codes I saw. 
I wasn't able to create a repetition system in it so that the user wouldn't have to rerun it every time. 
But I'm happy to at least have I got this =)
